//! Dispute resolution over escrows.
//!
//! A dispute freezes its escrow until a ruling is final. The lifecycle:
//!
//! 1. `raise_dispute` opens the dispute (`Open`) and blocks release/refund.
//! 2. `resolve_dispute` records the arbiter's ruling (`Resolved`, the winner
//!    and the ruling ledger). The payout stays **blocked**: per the appeal
//!    design, one arbiter ruling with no recourse is a poor guarantee, so the
//!    losing party has an appeal window measured in ledgers. Calling
//!    `resolve_dispute` again once the window has lapsed finalizes the ruling,
//!    settles the escrow and pays the winner.
//! 3. `appeal_dispute` — callable by the losing party inside the window —
//!    escalates the dispute (`Appealed`) and keeps the payout blocked.
//! 4. `resolve_appeal` hands down a final, unappealable ruling that settles the
//!    escrow, pays the declared winner and marks the dispute final. A second
//!    appeal on the same escrow is rejected.
//!
//! `is_dispute_open`/`get_dispute` are the read views clients use to render
//! dispute state without guessing from the escrow status.
